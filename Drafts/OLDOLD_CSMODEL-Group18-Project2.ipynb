    "### Data Structure\n",
    "Taking a look into the dataset, its overall content is composed of several integers per row stretching to a couple of columns. Each row is unique from the other with each one having reaching different numbers of columns. As for the context of the dataset, it would mainly focus on describing **customer transactions in a grocery**. Looking into the structure of the dataset, the **raw data** consists of **three hundred (300) observations** and at most **eight (8) variables**. \n",
    "\n",
    "As for the observations, each row uniquely describes a single customer transaction in a store. For this study, the transaction refers to a customer's basket containing items they intend to purchase. In relation to the observations, the variables on the other hand, for this study, represents the presence of a particular item in a customer's basket. \n",
    "\n",
    "At this section of the notebook, the raw data in the dataset uses integers within the range of **0-19** to represent an item in a single cell and an uneven distribution of columns per row. Each unique integer in a specific row represents an item's name (e.g. \"5\" refers to \"*Apples*\", \"10\" refers to \"*Coffee*\"). We could think of it as 1 to 2-digit 'bar codes' representing an item for each integer in a cell. Later into the study, these would be converted into a different and much easier representation. After which, the variables (columns) would refer to a particular item name. It would make use of only **1's** and **0's** for its values where the former indicates an item is **present** in the basket while the latter indicates **otherwise**.\n",
    "\n",
    "## `Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)`\n",
    "Prior to performing any data mining techniques to the dataset, we will explore the dataset by formulating and answering EDA questions to prompt the latter sections of the study.\n",
    "\n",
    "### EDA 1: `In each basket with most number of items in the dataset, which item is the most frequently purchased by the customers?`\n",
    "\n",
    "In a grocery setting and context, it is common practice for store owners to educate themselves of commonly bought items in order to increase sales. To do so, they would study the store's customer transaction data.\n",
    "\n",
    "In that case, using our dataset, we would only need to consider cells whose value is `1` in each column as this indicates that this particular item is bought by a customer in a single transaction. Each occurrence of `1` is tallied per column (item) and presented. After which, the Mode could be identified within the generated data.\n",
    "\n",
    "***Summary***\n",
    "Central Tendency: Mode <br>\n",
    "Visualization: Bar graph <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "**[Visualization 1: No graph]**\n",
    "\n",
    "From the data above, we can see the tallied results of the dataset for each item bought. With the current representation, the Mode is not that obvious as the data is sorted differently. Without having to re-sort it, we can place the results in a graph for better representation and visualization.\n",
    "\n",
    "**[Visualization 2: Graph]**\n",
    "\n",
    "In this type of visualization, the Mode could clearly be seen among the other bars. Based on the generated graph, the item frequently bought by customers is **`<ITEM>`** with a total of **`<NUMBER>`**. \n",
    "\n",
    "### EDA 2: `How many items do customers purchase usually?`\n",
    "\n",
    "Customers that purchase multiple items in a single transaction may increase frequency of other items. In this case, it would be natural to learn about the the usual number of items a basket contains per transaction. We may potentially see the presence of certain sets of items in a basket with multiple items and in turn, be able to answer the last EDA question.\n",
    "\n",
    "To do so, we would be approaching this similar to how the first EDA was answered which is by tallying the total occurrences of `1` in the dataset. However, for this question, the tally is done row-wise instead of column-wise like what was done before. As we are focused on knowing the Mean number of items bought by a customer, our target is the occurence of `1`'s per observation. After which, we would get the average of each row and obtain the Mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "***Summary***\n",
    "Central Tendency: Mean <br>\n",
    "Visualization: Bar graph/Bell curve(?) <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "**[Visualization 1: No graph]**\n",
    "\n",
    "The data above shows the number of items there is per row. Using the result, we can proceed to computing for the Mean. Likewise with the previous question, the generated result would also be accompanied with a visualization of the data below.\n",
    "\n",
    "**[Visualization 2: Graph]**\n",
    "\n",
    "According to the presented data in the graph above, we could say that the usual number of items in a basket bought by customers is **`<NUMBER>`**.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### EDA 3: `Is there a correlation between the number of items purchased and the number of occurrences where the most frequently purchased item is included in the basket?`\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the knowledge gained from the results on previous EDA questions, we arrive at the question whether the two results have any correlation or relationship. As a primary assumption on the dataset, baskets with more items may have the possibility of containing several different sets of frequently purchased items due to the large quantity.\n",
    "\n",
    "To check whether the assumption can be true, we begin by \n",
    "\n",
    "**[Visualization 1: No graph]**\n",
    "\n",
    "Judging from the generated above, we can see that **`<CHIKA>`**. To better see the results, we will be representing the data in a scatterplot to see if there is any relationship at all with the results.\n",
    "\n",
    "**[Visualization 2: Graph]**\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on the scatterplot above, it is clear that **`<CHIKA>`**\n",

    "In this section, we begin applying data mining techniques to the current dataset. For this study, we will make use of Associated Rule Mining techniques to further delve into the EDA questions.\n",

    "Let's start by **`<CHIKA>`**\n",
